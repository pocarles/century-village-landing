## Why Communication Matters

In Century Village's 55+ community, effective communication isn't just good practice—it's essential for smooth operations. Poor communication leads to:

- Owner distrust and conflict
- Increased complaints and requests
- Board member burnout
- Difficulty passing assessments or rule changes
- Higher turnover in board positions
- Legal challenges

Good communication creates:

- Owner confidence and cooperation
- Easier decision-making
- Reduced conflicts
- Higher participation in association activities
- Smoother board elections

## The Communication Challenge

Century Village boards face unique obstacles:

### The Generation Gap

- Some owners prefer email, others want phone calls or printed notices
- Technology comfort levels vary widely
- Not everyone checks email regularly
- Some owners have hearing or vision challenges

### The Information Overload Problem

- Too many emails leads to owner fatigue
- Important messages get buried
- Owners tune out routine communications
- Emergency notices get missed

### The Transparency Expectations

Florida's Sunshine Law creates high expectations:
- Owners expect access to records
- Meetings must be properly noticed
- Decisions should be explained
- Financial transparency is critical

## Communication Channels: Choosing the Right One

### Email: The Primary Tool

**Best for:**
- Regular updates and announcements
- Meeting notices
- Document distribution
- Non-urgent matters

**Tips:**
- Use clear, specific subject lines
- Keep messages brief and scannable
- Include action items at the top
- Send at consistent times (e.g., "Friday Updates")
- Archive important emails with meeting records

**Avoid:**
- Sending too frequently (causes fatigue)
- Discussing confidential matters
- Conducting board business (use meetings instead)
- Replying to angry emails while emotional

### Text/SMS: For Urgent Matters

**Best for:**
- Emergency notifications
- Last-minute meeting changes
- Urgent building issues
- Time-sensitive action required

**Tips:**
- Keep messages under 160 characters
- Include who, what, when, where
- Follow up with email for details
- Don't overuse (loses effectiveness)

**Example:**
```
URGENT: Water main break affecting units 
201-210. Water shut off until 6PM today. 
Updates at centurysync.com/alerts
```

### Phone Calls: For Personal Touch

**Best for:**
- Sensitive individual matters
- Following up on complaints
- Explaining complex issues
- Checking in with isolated owners

**Not ideal for:**
- Mass communications
- Official notices
- Documenting decisions

### Printed Notices: Don't Forget Them

**Still necessary for:**
- Owners without email
- Official legal notices
- Meeting announcements
- Rule changes and assessments

**Best practices:**
- Use large, readable fonts (14pt minimum)
- Post in common areas AND under doors
- Use color to highlight urgent information
- Include a "Questions? Contact..." section

### Your Website/Portal

**Essential for:**
- Document access
- Meeting minutes archive
- Financial transparency
- Vendor information
- Community calendar

**Should include:**
- Current budget and financial statements
- Meeting schedule and minutes
- Contact information for board members
- Frequently asked questions
- How to submit maintenance requests

## What to Communicate

### Regular Updates (Monthly)

**Board President's Update**
- Major decisions from last month
- Upcoming projects or changes
- Financial highlights
- Upcoming meetings or events

**Financial Summary**
- Month-end position vs. budget
- Major expenses
- Reserve fund status
- Any upcoming special assessments

**Maintenance & Projects**
- Completed work
- Ongoing projects and timelines
- Upcoming scheduled maintenance
- Any building issues and remediation plans

### Meeting Notices

Florida law requires specific notice for meetings:

**Board Meetings**
- 48 hours advance notice (posted conspicuously)
- Include date, time, location
- List major agenda items
- Include how to join if virtual

**Annual Member Meetings**
- Mailed notice 14-60 days before
- Include agenda
- Include information about proxies
- Explain voting procedures

**Special Assessments**
- Must be included in meeting notice
- Provide detailed explanation

### Emergency Communications

When urgent situations arise:

**Immediate:**
1. Send brief SMS/text alert
2. Post notice in lobbies/elevators
3. Update website/portal
4. Follow up with detailed email

**Template for emergencies:**
```
SUBJECT: URGENT: [Brief description]

WHAT: [One sentence describing situation]
WHEN: [When it happened/is happening]
WHERE: [Affected areas]
IMPACT: [How this affects owners]
NEXT STEPS: [What's being done]
UPDATES: [Where to get updates]

Contact [Name] at [Phone] for questions.
```

## Difficult Conversations

### Responding to Complaints

**The 24-Hour Rule**
- Don't respond immediately when emotional
- Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- Provide thoughtful response within 48-72 hours

**Template:**
```
Dear [Owner],

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. 
I want to make sure I fully understand your 
concern and gather relevant information before 
responding. I will follow up with you by 
[specific date] with more information.

[Board Member Name]
```

### Delivering Bad News

**Be direct but empathetic:**

❌ "We have to raise assessments because owners 
    keep complaining about stuff."

✅ "Our reserve study shows we need to fund roof 
    replacement over the next 5 years. This requires 
    a monthly assessment increase of $45 per unit 
    starting July 1. This keeps us compliant with 
    HB 1021 and protects our building value."

### Handling Angry Owners

**Remember:**
- Don't take it personally
- Listen actively (let them vent)
- Acknowledge their concern
- Stick to facts
- Follow up in writing

**Phrases that help:**
- "I understand your frustration..."
- "Let me make sure I understand correctly..."
- "Here's what we can do..."
- "I'll look into this and get back to you by..."

## Board-to-Board Communication

Internal board communication is just as important:

### Email Between Board Members

**Florida's Sunshine Law caution:**
- Don't use email to discuss board business outside meetings
- Don't reply-all to create a discussion
- Use email only for information sharing
- Conduct business in properly noticed meetings

**Safe uses:**
- Sharing documents
- Scheduling meetings
- Reporting factual information
- Delegating specific tasks

### Board Meetings

**Make them productive:**
- Circulate agenda 48 hours in advance
- Send supporting documents ahead of time
- Start and end on time
- Stay on agenda
- Document decisions clearly
- Assign action items with deadlines

## Building Transparency

### Share Information Proactively

Don't wait for owners to ask:
- Post meeting minutes within 7 days
- Share monthly financials
- Explain major decisions
- Publish project updates
- Make budgets accessible

### Create a FAQ

Answer common questions once:
- How do I request documents?
- When are board meetings?
- How do I submit a maintenance request?
- What's the process for architectural changes?
- How are assessments calculated?

### Use the "No Surprises" Rule

Give owners advance warning:
- Upcoming projects that affect them
- Potential assessment increases
- Rule changes being considered
- Major purchases or contracts
