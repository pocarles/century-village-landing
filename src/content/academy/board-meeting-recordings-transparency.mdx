## What Minutes Can't Capture

Board meeting minutes tell you what was decided. They don't tell you why, or how the conversation actually went, or what concerns were raised before the vote. Written minutes are one person's interpretation of what happened. A recording shows what actually happened.

That difference matters when an owner challenges a decision six months later.

## Why Florida COAs Are Recording Meetings

Florida law requires community associations to keep accurate records of board meetings. Most associations meet that requirement with written minutes. That's fine legally. But written minutes answer "what" without explaining "why."

We built CenturySync's video upload feature because owners kept asking: "What really went on in that meeting?" A two-page summary can't answer that question. A 45-minute recording can.

## What Changes When You Record

Does every owner watch the full recording? No. Most don't. But knowing they can changes board behavior. Discussions stay focused. Side conversations stop. Board members explain their reasoning instead of just voting.

Recording also changes owner behavior. Fewer conspiracy theories about secret deals. Fewer heated emails demanding explanations. When questions come up later, there's a clear record everyone can reference.

## HB 913 and Recording Requirements

Florida's HB 913 (effective July 1, 2025) requires associations to make meeting recordings available to owners if a recording was made. The law doesn't require you to record meetings. But if you do record, you must provide access.

What does "provide access" mean? You can't make owners come to the office during business hours to watch a video. You need a system that lets owners access recordings remotely, at their convenience. That's where CenturySync comes in.

## How to Record Board Meetings

The technical side is simpler than most boards think. You need three things: a recording device, a place to store the file, and a way for owners to access it.

**Recording devices:** Your phone works. So does a laptop, tablet, or dedicated audio recorder. Video is better than audio-only (you see who's speaking and catch visual context), but audio-only still beats written minutes.

**Storage:** Don't use personal devices or cloud accounts. Association records belong to the association, not individual board members. Upload recordings to CenturySync or another association-owned system immediately after each meeting.

**Owner access:** Attach the recording to the calendar event in CenturySync. Owners find it right next to the meeting date and agenda. No hunting through email or shared drives. No requesting access from the board secretary.

## What to Record

Record all board meetings. Regular monthly meetings, special meetings, emergency meetings, and workshop sessions all count. Committee meetings don't require recording under HB 913, but you might record them anyway for transparency.

Don't record executive sessions. Florida law allows boards to meet privately to discuss pending litigation, personnel matters, and contract negotiations. Those sessions remain confidential. Recording them creates liability.

## Common Concerns

**"Won't recording make board members nervous?"** Yes, initially. That nervousness usually improves meeting quality. Board members explain their reasoning instead of making cryptic statements. They stay on topic. They avoid personal attacks. That's exactly what you want.

**"What if someone says something they regret?"** They'll learn to think before speaking. That's not a bug, that's a feature. Board decisions affect property values and owner finances. Board members should think before they speak.

**"Will owners use recordings against the board?"** They might. If the board did something wrong, owners should know about it. If the board did nothing wrong, the recording proves it. Either way, transparency wins.

**"How long do we keep recordings?"** Florida law requires five years of retention for meeting records. Apply the same timeline to recordings. CenturySync stores them indefinitely, so you don't have to decide.

## Real Benefits We've Seen

Associations that record meetings report three consistent benefits:

**Fewer disputes:** When owners can watch the actual discussion, they understand the board's reasoning. Disagreement happens, but conspiracy theories disappear.

**Better board behavior:** Recording keeps discussions professional. Board members explain their votes. Side conversations and personal attacks vanish.

**Easier transitions:** New board members watch previous meetings to understand ongoing issues. Historical context doesn't walk out the door with departing members.

## How CenturySync Makes This Simple

Upload your recording to CenturySync. It stores securely. Attach it to the calendar event. Owners access it through their portal. You stay compliant with HB 913. No extra software. No complicated setup.

Recordings stay associated with the meeting date, agenda, and minutes. Everything lives in one place. When an owner asks about a decision from eight months ago, you send them the link. Done.

## File Formats and Size

CenturySync accepts all major formats: MP4, MOV, MP3, WAV, M4A, and more. Video or audio, phone recording or professional equipment, it works.

File size used to be a problem. Not anymore. We handle files up to 50MB via Telegram, and unlimited size via direct upload. A 90-minute board meeting in HD video is typically 1 to 2GB. No problem.

## What to Tell Owners

When you start recording meetings, announce it clearly. Put a notice in the newsletter. Post it on the bulletin board. Include it in the meeting agenda. Tell owners where they'll find recordings and how long before they're posted.

Don't make a bigger deal out of it than necessary. Recording meetings isn't revolutionary. It's basic transparency. Most owners will appreciate it without needing an explanation.

## What to Tell Board Members

Some board members resist recording. They worry about being "on the record" or making mistakes. Address this directly.

Explain that written minutes are also "on the record." The difference is that recordings show context. When a board member explains their reasoning before voting, owners understand the decision. When minutes just show a vote tally, owners assume the worst.

Remind them that professional behavior during meetings is already expected. Recording doesn't create new standards, it just documents compliance with existing ones.

## The Political Argument

Recording board meetings removes ammunition from political opponents. When everything is on video, claims about secret deals or hidden agendas fall apart. Board members who want to criticize decisions can watch the recording and see exactly what was said.

This protects good boards and exposes bad ones. If your board makes good decisions for good reasons, recording proves it. If your board makes questionable decisions for unclear reasons, recording exposes that too. Either way, owners win.

## Start Small

Don't overthink this. Start with your next board meeting. Use your phone to record video. Upload it to CenturySync. Attach it to the calendar event. Done.

After three or four meetings, recording becomes routine. Board members forget the camera is there. Owners appreciate the transparency. And when someone questions a decision, you have proof of what actually happened.

Video isn't required by law yet. But it's the clearest way to show your board has nothing to hide.
