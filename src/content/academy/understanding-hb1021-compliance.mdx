## What is HB 1021?

Florida's House Bill 1021, signed into law following the tragic Surfside condominium collapse, represents one of the most significant changes to condominium association requirements in decades. This legislation fundamentally changes how Florida COAs must approach building safety, financial planning, and reserve funding.

### Key Requirements at a Glance

HB 1021 introduces several critical requirements that every Florida condo association must address:

1. **Milestone Structural Inspections**: Buildings three stories or higher that are at least 30 years old (or 25 years old if within three miles of the coast) must undergo comprehensive structural inspections
2. **Reserve Study Requirements**: Associations must conduct reserve studies and fund reserves for major building components
3. **Transparency and Reporting**: Enhanced disclosure requirements for unit owners regarding building safety and financial health

## Milestone Structural Inspections

### Who Needs Them?

Your association requires a milestone inspection if your building meets these criteria:

- **Three stories or taller** (excluding parking levels)
- **30 years old or older** (25 years if located within 3 miles of coastline)
- Located anywhere in Florida

### Timeline and Deadlines

The inspection must be completed by December 31st of the year when the building reaches the milestone age. For buildings that already exceeded the milestone age when HB 1021 took effect, inspections were due by December 31, 2024.

### What Gets Inspected?

Licensed engineers or architects must examine:

- Load-bearing elements and primary structural members
- Fireproofing and fire protection systems
- Exterior waterproofing and water intrusion points
- Roofing systems and drainage
- Electrical, mechanical, and plumbing systems serving common elements

## Reserve Studies: No More Waivers

One of the most impactful changes in HB 1021 is the elimination of the reserve waiver option for structural and life safety components.

### What This Means for Your Association

Starting December 31, 2024, associations can no longer vote to waive or reduce reserve funding for:

- Roof replacement and repairs
- Building painting
- Pavement resurfacing
- Pool resurfacing
- Other structural components identified in the reserve study

### Financial Impact

For many associations, particularly those that historically operated with minimal or waived reserves, this requirement represents a significant budget adjustment. Associations must now:

1. Conduct a reserve study (or update an existing one)
2. Include reserve funding in their annual budget
3. Collect assessments sufficient to meet reserve funding requirements
4. Maintain separate reserve accounts

## Staying Compliant: A Checklist

Here's what your board should do right now:

- [ ] **Determine if your building requires a milestone inspection**
- [ ] **Schedule your structural inspection** if you haven't already
- [ ] **Commission or update your reserve study**
- [ ] **Review and adjust your budget** to include required reserve funding
- [ ] **Communicate changes to owners** about assessment impacts
- [ ] **Document everything** - inspections, studies, board decisions, and owner communications
- [ ] **Set up proper reserve accounts** with your financial institution

## Common Questions

### What happens if we don't comply?

Non-compliance can result in serious consequences:
- Individual board member liability
- Inability to sell units (buyers can void contracts within 3 days of receiving unfavorable inspection reports)
- Potential fines from local building departments
- Increased liability in case of building failure

### Can we phase in reserve funding?

Yes, the law allows associations to phase in reserve funding over a reasonable period, but you must demonstrate a clear plan to reach full funding. Consult with your association attorney for specific guidance.

### How often must inspections be repeated?

Once completed, milestone inspections must be repeated every 10 years.

## Next Steps

Don't wait until deadlines approach. Start now:

1. **Review your building's age and location** to determine milestone inspection requirements
2. **Schedule a board meeting** specifically to address HB 1021 compliance
3. **Engage qualified professionals** - licensed engineers for inspections, qualified firms for reserve studies
4. **Plan your budget** with your treasurer or management company
5. **Communicate proactively** with your owners about upcoming changes

HB 1021 compliance isn't optional, but it doesn't have to be overwhelming. With proper planning and the right tools, your board can navigate these requirements while maintaining owner trust and building safety.
