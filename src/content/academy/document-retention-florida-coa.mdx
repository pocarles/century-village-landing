## Why Document Retention Matters

Florida law requires condominium associations to maintain official records and make them available to owners within specific timeframes. Failure to comply can result in:

- Legal liability for board members
- Fines up to $500 per day for non-compliance
- Inability to defend against lawsuits
- Loss of institutional knowledge
- Difficulty responding to owner record requests (10-day requirement)

## What Documents Must You Keep?

### Permanent Records (Keep Forever)

These documents should be retained indefinitely:

**Governing Documents**
- Original Declaration of Condominium
- Articles of Incorporation
- Bylaws and amendments
- Rules and Regulations (current and all historical versions)

**Property Records**
- Original construction documents and as-built plans
- Surveys and legal descriptions
- Easement agreements
- Warranty information for major systems

**Historical Financial Records**
- Annual financial statements and audited financials
- Tax returns and related correspondence
- Major capital improvement records

### 7-Year Retention

- Insurance policies (keep 7 years after expiration)

**Assessments and Collections**
- Special assessment records
- Payment histories
- Collection correspondence

### 5-Year Retention

**Meeting Records**

**Correspondence**

### 4-Year Retention

**Contracts and Agreements**

## The Century Village Challenge

Many Century Village associations face unique challenges:

### Decades of Paper Records

Buildings from the 1970s often have:
- 40+ years of meeting minutes in cardboard boxes
- Mixed filing systems from different board administrations
- Documents stored in board members' homes
- No digital backup of critical records
- Inconsistent organization

### Board Turnover

In a 55+ community:
- Presidents and treasurers change frequently
- Knowledge walks out the door with departing members
- New boards start from scratch
- Historical context is lost

### Space Constraints

Physical storage problems include:
- Limited on-site storage space
- Risk of water damage, fire, or deterioration
- No climate control for sensitive documents
- Security concerns for confidential records

## Building Your Document System

### Step 1: Audit What You Have

Create an inventory:

```
1. Gather all known records
2. Sort by document type
3. Identify gaps in your records
4. Assess physical condition
5. Prioritize critical documents for immediate scanning
```

### Step 2: Organize by Category

Create a filing structure:

**Category 1: Governing Documents**
- Declaration, Bylaws, Articles
- Rules and Regulations (all versions)
- Amendments and modifications

**Category 2: Financial**
- By year, then by month
- Separate audits and tax returns
- Major contracts and capital improvements

**Category 3: Meeting Records**
- Chronological by year
- Board meetings separate from member meetings
- Include all supporting documents

**Category 4: Correspondence**
- By year and topic
- Legal matters separate
- Owner communications

**Category 5: Building & Property**
- Maintenance records
- Inspection reports
- Warranty and service contracts
- Architectural and engineering documents

### Step 3: Go Digital

Benefits of digitizing records:

- **Instant search**: Find any document in seconds instead of hours
- **Space savings**: Eliminate boxes and filing cabinets
- **Backup protection**: No risk of fire, flood, or loss
- **Easy sharing**: Respond to owner requests instantly
- **Accessibility**: Board members can access from anywhere
- **Compliance**: Meet the 10-day response requirement easily

### Step 4: Establish Ongoing Processes

Create systems for new documents:

1. **Email-to-archive**: Forward documents directly to your system
2. **Regular uploads**: Set a monthly reminder to upload new documents
3. **Naming conventions**: Use consistent, searchable names
4. **Version control**: Track amendments and revisions
5. **Access controls**: Limit who can see confidential documents

## Owner Record Requests

Florida law (FS 718.111) requires associations to provide official records within 10 business days of a written request.

### What Owners Can Request

Owners have the right to inspect and copy:
- Governing documents
- Financial records and budgets
- Contracts costing over $10,000
- Bids for work over $10,000
- Meeting minutes
- Rules and regulations
- Roster of owners (for association business)

### What You Can Restrict

Certain records can be limited:
- Personnel records
- Medical records
- Social security numbers
- Bank account information
- Attorney-client privileged communications

### Response Timeline

You have **10 business days** to:
1. Provide the records
2. Provide written notice you'll need up to an additional 10 days
3. Deny the request (with legal justification)

Failure to respond properly can result in **$500/day fines**.

## Document Destruction

When retention periods expire, proper destruction is important:

### Shredding Requirements

For confidential documents:
- Use cross-cut shredding
- Document the destruction (date, what was destroyed, who authorized it)
- Never throw confidential documents in regular trash

### Electronic Deletion

For digital records:
- Ensure proper deletion (not just "delete" but secure erasure)
- Remove from all backup systems
- Document the deletion

## Best Practices

### For Small Associations

If you don't have management:
1. Designate one board member as records custodian
2. Use a simple cloud storage system
3. Scan critical documents first
4. Build your digital archive gradually
5. Back up everything regularly

### For Century Village Buildings

Given the unique environment:
1. Prioritize scanning historical minutes and financial records
2. Create a transition binder for new boards
3. Store original governing documents in a safe deposit box
4. Use CenturySync or similar system for easy owner access
5. Train each new board on the document system

### Email Management

Email is a record if it contains official business:
- Forward important emails to your archive
- Don't conduct official business on personal email
- Include relevant emails with meeting minutes
- Set up retention rules in your email system

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Keeping everything forever**: Clutters your system and increases storage costs  
❌ **Throwing away "old" documents**: You might be discarding permanent records  
❌ **Storing originals in one location**: Risk losing everything to fire/flood  
❌ **Using personal email/cloud**: These are association records, not personal files  
❌ **No backup system**: Digital files can be lost too  
❌ **Incomplete meeting minutes**: These are your official record of decisions  
❌ **Missing retention policy**: Board members need clear guidelines
