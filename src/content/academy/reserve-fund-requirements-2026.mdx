## January 1, 2026 Is Not a Suggestion

It is a deadline, and many Florida condo associations are not ready.

If your building has 25 or more units, you now face stricter reserve requirements than ever before. The threshold for fully funded reserves jumped from $10,000 to $25,000. That sounds like good news until you realize what it actually means: every project expected to cost $25,000 or more must have money set aside. Not partially funded. Not "we'll figure it out later." Funded.

This is the direct result of HB 1021 and HB 913, two bills that rewrote the rules for Florida community associations after years of deferred maintenance led to tragedy.

## What Changed?

Three things matter most.

**The reserve threshold increased.** Before, associations had to reserve for components costing $10,000 or more. Now it's $25,000, with annual inflation adjustments starting February 1, 2026. This gives boards some breathing room on minor repairs, but it does not eliminate the obligation. It shifts the focus to bigger items.

**The Structural Integrity Reserve Study (SIRS) deadline passed.** As of December 31, 2025, every condo building three stories or taller, or 30 years old or older, should have completed a SIRS. If your building missed that deadline, you are already out of compliance.

**Website requirements expanded.** Condos with 25 or more units must now provide digital access to association documents. This includes the declaration, bylaws, annual budget, financial reports, meeting minutes, contracts, and reserve studies. If you only offer paper copies, you are violating state law.

## What the SIRS Must Include

A SIRS is not a general inspection. It examines specific components that affect structural integrity and safety:

- Roof
- Load-bearing walls and structure
- Fire protection systems
- Plumbing
- Electrical systems
- Waterproofing and exterior painting
- Windows and exterior doors

The study must be performed by a licensed engineer, licensed architect, certified reserve specialist, or professional reserve analyst. It must include estimated remaining useful life, replacement cost, deferred maintenance expense, and a funding schedule for each component.

This is not paperwork. It is the document that tells you whether your building can pay for what it needs.

## The Penalties Are Real

Florida does not treat record violations as administrative inconveniences.

Knowingly destroying association records is a first-degree misdemeanor. A director or manager who repeatedly denies access to records commits a second-degree misdemeanor. Refusing to release records to avoid legal consequences is a third-degree felony.

Board members can be removed from office for failing to comply with access requirements.

## What This Means for Your Board

If you have not completed your SIRS, start now. The deadline passed, but late compliance is better than none.

If your reserves are underfunded, build a plan to reach full funding. Special assessments may be necessary. Loans may be an option. Pretending the problem does not exist is not.

If your association lacks a website or app with required documents, that gap needs to close immediately. The law does not care whether your building has always done things on paper.

## Common Mistakes Boards Make

**Assuming the new threshold means less work.** The $25,000 floor doesn't eliminate reserve obligations. It concentrates them on bigger, more expensive repairs. Roofs, elevators, parking structures, plumbing risers. These are the items that bankrupt associations when they fail unexpectedly.

**Treating SIRS as optional.** Some boards delayed their structural study hoping requirements would change. They didn't. Now those boards face compliance gaps and potential liability.

**Ignoring the website requirement.** Many Century Village buildings still distribute paper newsletters and post notices on bulletin boards. That worked in 1985. It violates Florida law in 2026.

**Waiving reserves without understanding consequences.** Florida law allows owners to vote to waive or reduce reserves under certain conditions. This is almost always a mistake. You're not saving money. You're borrowing from a future special assessment.

## How to Get Compliant

Start with your SIRS. If you haven't done one, get quotes from qualified professionals this week. The longer you wait, the longer your liability exposure.

Review your reserve study. Compare current funding levels to what your SIRS recommends. If there's a gap, present the board with options: increase assessments, levy a special assessment, or obtain a loan.

Audit your document access. Can owners view required records online? If not, you need a solution. A website with password-protected access satisfies the requirement. Paper binders in the management office do not.

Document your compliance efforts. If regulators ask questions, you want a paper trail showing you took requirements seriously, even if you started late.
