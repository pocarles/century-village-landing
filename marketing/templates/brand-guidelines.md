# CenturySync Brand Guidelines

## Voice & Tone

**Who we sound like:** Pierre-Olivier — a French founder who's direct, practical, and slightly irreverent. No corporate fluff.

**Principles:**
- **Direct** — Say what you mean. No hedge words.
- **Practical** — Focus on what it does, not what it "empowers" or "enables"
- **Confident** — We know this works. No apologetic language.
- **Human** — Write like you're explaining to a smart friend, not a committee

**Avoid:**
- "We're excited to announce..."
- "Leverage", "synergy", "empower"
- Passive voice when active works
- Long sentences when short ones hit harder

## Murray the Mascot

Murray is an anthropomorphic manatee — CenturySync's friendly face.

**Personality:** Laid-back but competent. Like a chill Florida board president who actually gets things done.

**Use Murray for:**
- Feature announcements (celebratory)
- Onboarding (welcoming)
- Error states (apologetic but helpful)
- Compliance reminders (slightly stressed, then relieved)

**Don't use Murray for:**
- Serious legal/compliance documentation
- Formal board communications
- Anything requiring gravitas

## Colors

- **Primary Blue:** #2563EB (CenturySync blue)
- **Secondary:** #10B981 (success green), #F59E0B (warning amber)
- **Neutral:** #1F2937 (text), #F9FAFB (background)

## Logo

Use the CenturySync wordmark. Murray can appear alongside but not replace the logo.

## Compliance Messaging

When referencing Florida laws:
- Always cite the bill number (HB 1021, HB 913, etc.)
- Include effective dates
- Position CenturySync as proactive, not reactive
- "Stay compliant" not "avoid fines" (positive framing)
